# RecommendationSystem-User-CF

It is a mean of recommendation based on usersâ€™ past behavior. There are two categories of CF:

User-based: measure the similarity between target users and other users

Item-based: measure the similarity between the items that target users rates/ interacts with and other items

The key idea behind CF is that similar users share the same interest and that similar items are liked by a user.
